# Project Euler #2: Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with **1** and **2**, the first **10** terms will be:

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed ***N***, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Input Format

First line contains ***T*** that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by ***T*** lines, each containing an integer, ***N***.

### Constraints

- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Clarge%201%20%5Cleqslant%20T%20%5Cleqslant%2010%5E5)
- ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Clarge%2010%20%5Cleqslant%20N%20%5Cleqslant%204%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B16%7D)

### Output Format

Print the required answer for each test case.

### Sample Input 0

    2
    10
    100

### Sample Output 0

    10
    44

### Explanation 0

- For ***N* = 10**, we have **{2, 8}**, sum is **10**.
- For ***N* = 100**, we have **{2, 8, 34}**, sum is **44**.
